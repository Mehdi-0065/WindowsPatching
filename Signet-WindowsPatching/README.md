# Signet-WindowsPatching Module

## Introduction

The **Signet-WindowsPatching** module is designed to automate and streamline the patch management process for Windows servers. This module provides a set of cmdlets to retrieve information, manage patch deployment, and perform various tasks related to server maintenance. The module is particularly useful for IT professionals managing a large number of servers in an enterprise environment.

## Installation

To install the **Signet-WindowsPatching** module, follow these steps:

1. Download the module files and place them in a directory named `Signet-WindowsPatching` within one of the PowerShell module paths (e.g., `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\`).

2. Import the module into your PowerShell session using:
  ```powershell
  Import-Module Signet-WindowsPatching


  3. Run the `generate-patchlist.ps1` script to generate a list of available patches for your Windows servers. This script collects information about the installed patches on each server and creates a CSV file containing the patch details.

    ```powershell
    .\generate-patchlist.ps1 -OutputPath C:\PatchList.csv
    ```
by default the location of patchlist file is in \\isilon.jewels.com\Patching$\windows\patchlist. the rest of scripts will get access to this file as their refrence 
    The generated CSV file will include information such as the KB number, description, installation date, and status of each patch. This list can be used for further analysis or to plan patch deployment across your server infrastructure.

  4. Once you have the patch list, you can use the other cmdlets provided by the **Signet-WindowsPatching** module to manage patch deployment, install specific patches, or perform other maintenance tasks on your Windows servers.

  For more information on how to use the **Signet-WindowsPatching** module, refer to the module's documentation or run `Get-Help` on individual cmdlets.


  ## WindowsPatch-Prod.ps1

  The `WindowsPatch-Prod.ps1` file is a PowerShell script that is designed to be run on Windows servers either locally or remotely using the `schedule-task.ps1` file. This script is a key component of the **Signet-WindowsPatching** module and is responsible for automating the patch deployment process on Windows servers.

  When executed, the `WindowsPatch-Prod.ps1` script performs the following tasks:

  1. Retrieves the patch list generated by the `generate-patchlist.ps1` script.

  2. Analyzes the patch list to determine which patches need to be installed on each server.

  3. Downloads the required patches from the appropriate sources, such as Windows Update or a local patch repository.

  4. Installs the patches on the target servers, ensuring that the installation process is logged and any errors or failures are reported.

  5. Verifies the successful installation of the patches and updates the patch status in the patch list.

  By running the `WindowsPatch-Prod.ps1` script, you can automate the patch deployment process and ensure that your Windows servers are up to date with the latest security and feature updates. Whether you choose to run the script locally or remotely using the `schedule-task.ps1` file, the **Signet-WindowsPatching** module provides a convenient and efficient way to manage patch deployment across your server infrastructure.

  For detailed instructions on how to use the `WindowsPatch-Prod.ps1` script and the **Signet-WindowsPatching** module, please refer to the module's documentation or run `Get-Help` on the individual cmdlets.
